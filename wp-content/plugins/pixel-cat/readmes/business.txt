== Description ==

= Facebook Pixel Management Made Easy =

Confused by Facebook's pixel code? Wary of pasting a script into your theme?

ConvertCat is a lean, simple plugin that avoids unnecessary bloat and does one thing well: letting you add the new Facebook pixel to your site with ease.

* Create Facebook Pixel Events using our Event Builder.

= Why use ConvertCat - Facebook Pixel Manager? =

There are multiple ways to add a Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site.

**1. Pasting your Facebook Pixel into your theme**
This approach isn't great for two reasons:
a) If you edit your live site and make a mistake when pasting your Facebook Pixel script into your theme, you could take down your website.
b) If your theme is updated with new features or security fixes, your Facebook Pixel code will be overwritten.

**2. Pasting the new Facebook Pixel script into a header/footer script plugin**
This is a valid approach, but has some disadvantages. General purposes "header script plugins" aren't built from the ground-up to support Facebook's Pixel. 

What this means is that :
a) These plugins lack Facebook-specific functionality.
b) These plugins will not adapt if Facebook changes their pixel again in the future. Since ConvertCat is a dedicated Facebook Pixel Manager, we'll make sure make sure to stay compatible with future changes by Facebook.
c) These plugins usually don't support hiding your Facebook Pixel from logged-in users.


The bottom line is that ConvertCat is the best way to add a Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site.
